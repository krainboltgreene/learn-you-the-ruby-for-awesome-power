Is This Going To Be Hard?
-------------------------------------

Programming is largely three things: Concepts, Syntax, and Paradigms.
Concepts in programming tend to be universally the same, but Syntax and Paradigms can be wildly different.
Paradigms are generally formed from the way languages use Syntax to abstract Concepts.
So it should make sense that once you learn the Syntax, Concepts and Paradigms naturally follow.
That said you have to be willing to learn, constantly, and forever.
Programming is a moving target even if you want to work with old stuff.
In short: No, not hard, but not a trivial task.


Who Are You?
------------

I'm the author of this book, a father, hacker, designer, and writer (as you may have gathered).


Why Do You Like Ruby?
---------------------

As a writer I find myself naturally enjoying the Ruby expressive syntax.
It's a very human form of communication between man and machine, and that helped me ease into it.
It also happens that I can make a lot of money developing in Ruby.


Who Built This Site?
-----------------------

This is an easy one: I built this website!
All of it.
To elaborate I wrote the HTML with HAML, and the CSS with SASS.
Each chapter is formatted with the RedCloth markdown language.
The web site (and pdf) runs on Nanoc, a simple static site generating framework.


Why Did You Build This Website?
--------------------------------

I found that teaching was as much of a learning experience for me as it was for others.


Can You Help Me?
----------------

I can and will help those who want to help others, all you have to do is contact
me.
