Task Zero
---------

**Summary**: Install & Setup

This is the most important *task* in the entire book.
This task will detail each step required to get Ruby running on your computer.
Without Ruby you can't run the code you build and that makes this entire thing worthless.
Oh we also talk about your workstation.

**Source Code**

#### Ubuntu

1. Open A Terminal
    * Type in the parts that look like `this` into Terminal.
2. Install RVM Dependencies
    * `sudo apt-get install curl git-core`
3. Install RVM
    * `bash < <(curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head)`
    * `rvmsrc='[[ -s "~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]]'`
    * `echo $rvmsrc >> ~/.bash_profile && echo $rvmsrc >> ~/.bashrc`
4. Install Ruby Dependencies
    * `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm notes`
    * Read the instructions from the above command, you're looking for the `mri` dependencies.
5. Install Ruby

    * `gem -v`
    * Make sure all of the above commands didn't result in an error.
7. Install Gedit
    * `sudo apt-get install gedit`
    * If already installed, then type `gedit`
8. Setup Gedit
    * In gedit, open the Edit menu and go to Preferences.
    * Turn on **Highlight Current Line**.
    * Go to the Editor tab.
    * Change **Tab Width** to 4.
      Turn On **Insert Spaces Inst...** and **Enable Auto...**
    * Save and close Gedit.

#### Windows

1. Open up Terminal
    * Type in the parts that look like `this` into Terminal.
7. Install Gedit
    * ...

    * Make sure all of the above commands didn't result in an error.
8. Setup Gedit
    * In gedit, open the Edit menu and go to Preferences.
    * Turn on **Highlight Current Line**.
    * Go to the Editor tab.
    * Change **Tab Width** to 4.
      Turn On **Insert Spaces Inst...** and **Enable Auto...**
    * Save and close Gedit.


#### Mac OS X

1. Open up Terminal
    * Type in the parts that look like `this` into Terminal.
2. Install RVM Dependencies:
    * `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSLk https://gist.github.com/raw/323731/install_homebrew.rb)"`
    * `open https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=20792`
    * Login and install XCode.
    * `brew install curl git`
3. Install RVM
    * `bash < <(curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head)`
    * `rvmsrc='[[ -s "~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]]'`

8. Setup Gedit
    * In gedit, open the Edit menu and go to Preferences.
    * Turn on **Highlight Current Line**.
    * Go to the Editor tab.
    * Change **Tab Width** to 4.
      Turn On **Insert Spaces Inst...** and **Enable Auto...**
    * Save and close Gedit.

**Results**

You should have Git, RVM, Ruby 1.9.2, and Gedit installed and ready to use.

**Details**

The steps above assume one thing: You know the very basics about using your computer.
If you don't understand how your computer works you need to take some classes, explore, and learn.
Don't go beyond this point until you do.
Ruby, and other languages, are tools and tools require that much respect to use.

**Extra Credit**

* Open a few text files with Gedit, get to know the interface.
* Customize Gedit, Terminal, and your Operating System to better suit your style.
* Type these in the Terminal:
    * `rvm use 1.9.2@global`
    * `gem install bundler rake`
    * `rvm use 1.9.2`


Task One
--------

**Summary**: Text & Output

Now that you've gone through the installation and setup task you should know what the Terminal is.
This task will show you how to print text directly to the Terminal.
Don't remember what to do?
Look [here](/book/chapter/1/).

**Source Code**: File `~/Repository/lytr/task-1.rb`

~~~ language-ruby
puts "A Boy And His Lucky Dog"
puts "================="
puts "It was a cold winter morning in the Forgotten Valley."
puts 'The boy looked to his dog and said, "Look there, Lucky!"'
puts '"The Temple of Golden Arches!" The dog glumly barked.'
puts "Venturing forth they climb down from the mountainside."
puts '"We are sure to find lost treasure!"'
puts 'The abandoned temple to the Golden Arches awaited.'
~~~

**Results**: Run `ruby task-1.rb`

A Boy And His Lucky Dog
=================
It was a cold winter morning in the Forgotten Valley.
The boy looked to his dog and said, "Look there, Lucky!"
"The Temple of Golden Arches!" The dog glumly barked.
Venturing forth they climb down from the mountainside.
"We are sure to find lost treasure!"
The abandoned temple to the Golden Arches awaited.

**Details**

Hey, look you just wrote your first Ruby Program!
Just think, this time tomorrow you'll have written at least two programs, maybe three.
I know it's pretty exciting, but lets calm down no need to exaust ourselves.
What have we actually done by writing and running this problem, you ask?

Well, lets see:

1. You've written your first method.
2. You've written your first string.
3. You've used the `"` and `'` characters to signify a String.

Running this script made a small story form before your very eyes.
It's time to describe each portion of this source code:

* Each line in the source code tells the Ruby interpreter to print the string out to the display.
* The `puts` method, an action in Ruby, sends text to the output.
  Specifically the Terminal, in this case.
* `"` or the *double quote* and the `'` or the *single quote* are the syntax characters used to denote a String, in Ruby.
* A String is a series of characters connected together.

Notice that there is a space between `puts` and the first `"` or `'`.
This is a single *whitespace* space character.
You can put as many whitespace space characters as you want between `puts` and the String.
The Ruby interpretor will ignore those spaces.
Other *whitespace* characters include the tab character and the return character.

**Extra Credit**

* Change some of the words (other than puts) in the story.
* Add some extra words and characters to the story.
* Add some extra lines to the story with extra puts methods.
* Change the `'` to `"` characters and run the code.
  What happens?
  Then revert to the original.
* Change the `puts` method to something else and run the code.
  What happens?
  Then revert to the original.

puts "The adventurous two wandered through abandoned cities and towns."

# puts "Avoiding raiders and wastelanders." # This is line is a comment.

print "One time the two happened on a small village named "
puts '"Wall Mart Town"'

### You can put multiple pound signs, but it doesn't read anything after the
## first pound sign. ##
    # You can even indent the comments!

print "\"Hey Lucky,\" the boy says"
print " "
puts "\"Lets check this place out!\""
puts "The dog didn't think this was a good idea."

**Results**: Run `ruby task-2.rb`

~~~ language-terminal
The Wealthiest Merchant And His Daughter
========================================
The boy and his lucky dog travelled along the wasteland together.
They saw many things, but mostly trash and death.
The adventurous two wandered through abandoned cities and towns.
One time the two happened on a small village named "Wall Mart Town"
"Hey Lucky," the boy says "Lets check this place out!"
The dog didn't think this was a good idea.
~~~

**Details**

In the previous task you were introduced to the `puts` method.
In this task we see a new method being used, the `print` method.
You may notice something different about the output `print` produces.
This is because `print` does **not** append a `\n` or *new line* character to the text, where `puts` does.
This means that two lines of `print` will concatenate (or plug together) in the output.

You may also notice two new characters introduced in this task.
The first is the `#` character or *pound* sign, sometimes called a *hash*.
You will notice in the Result that the text after the `#` are completely ignored!
This is called a *comment*. Comments are bits of text used to describe the intent or process of the code around them.
This is a great documentation tool and should be used when necessary to help others, and yourself, later understand things.

The second special character you might have noticed is `\` character or *blackslash*.
The `\` does two things depending on what character it is prepended to.
In this source they are prepended to `"` characters.
This use, inside `"` wrapped strings tells the interpreter to treat the `"` as a regular character instead of the start or end of a string.
The `\` is printed directly if inside a `'` wrapped string.

**Extra Credit**

* Remove the first `#` character on line 14 and run the code.
  What happens?
* Add more string arguments to the `puts` and `print` methods.
* Delete line 24 and run the code.
  What happens?
  Then revert the changes.
* Insert `\n` characters into one of the strings wrapped with `"` characters and run the code.
  What happens?
  Then revert the changes.
* Insert `\n` characters into one of the strings wrapped with `'` characters and run the code.
  What happens?
  Then revert the changes.
