### Summary

This is the most important Task in the entire book.
This task will detail each step required to get Ruby running on your computer.
Without Ruby you can't run the code you build and that makes this entire thing worthless.
Oh we also talk about your workstation.

### Source Code

#### Ubuntu

1. Open up Terminal:
    1. Click on the magnifying glass in the top right of your screen.
    2. Type `Terminal` and press enter.
    3. Type in the parts that look like `this` into Terminal and press enter.
2. Install dependencies:
    2. `sudo apt-get install build-essential bison autoconf g++ \ `
    3. `zlib1g-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev \ `
    4. `libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev \ `
    5. `curl git-core subversion` then `yes`.
3. Install Ruby & Friends
    1. `bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )`
    2. `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm install --default 1.9.2`
4. Setup your environment:
    1. `mkdir ~/repo ~/repo/rb ~/repo/rb/lytr && cd ~/repo/rb/lytr`
    2. `rvmsrc='[[ -s "~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]]' && echo $rvmsrc >> ~/.bash_profile && echo $rvmsrc >> ~/.bashrc`
    3. `curl https://github.com/krainboltgreene/dotfiles/blob/master/gemrc -o ~/.gemrc && gedit ~/.bashrc`
    4. In gedit add `# ` in front (On the same line) as: `[ -z "$PS1" ] && return` if it's there.
5. Make yourself comfortable in Gedit:
    1. Turn on `Highlight Cur...` and `Highlight Mat...`
    2. Go to the Editor tab.
    3. `Tab Width` change to 4. Turn On `Insert Spaces Inst...` and `Enable Auto...`
6. Save and close gedit. Type `exit` in the Terminal.
7. Add the Terminal & Gedit shortcuts to the panel

#### Windows

1. Magic Happens.

    1. Click on the magnifying glass in the top right of your screen.
    2. Type `Terminal` and press enter.
    3. Type in the parts that look like `this` into Terminal.
2. Install brew:
    1. `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSLk https://gist.github.com/raw/323731/install_homebrew.rb)"`
    2. `open https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=20792`
    3. Login and install XCode.
3. Install Ruby & Friends:
    1. `brew install curl git`
    2. `bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )`
4. Setup your environment:
    1. `mkdir ~/repo ~/repo/rb ~/repo/rb/lytr && cd ~/repo/rb/lytr`
    2. `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm install --default 1.9.2`
    3. `rvmsrc='[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && echo $rvmsrc >> ~/.bash_profile && echo $rvmsrc >> ~/.bashrc`
    4. `curl https://github.com/krainboltgreene/dotfiles/blob/master/gemrc -o ~/.gemrc && open ~/.bashrc`
    5. In gedit add `# ` in front (On the same line) as: `[ -z "$PS1" ] && return` if it's there.
5. Install and setup GEdit:
    1. ...

    3. ...
    4. In gedit, open the Edit menu and go to Preferences.

    8. Save and close gedit. Type `exit` in the Terminal.
    9. Add the Terminal & Gedit shortcuts to the dock

### Results

You should have working instances of Ruby Version Manager, Ruby 1.9.2, and Gedit.
With a interpeter, an editor, and a computer you're well on your way to becoming a developer!
If you happened to encoutner an error simply go to http://gist.github.com.
Paste the error message (if you can) along with the step you were on.
Then create a new issue at [my issues page](http://github.com/krainboltgreene/learn-you-the-ruby-for-awesome-power/issues) with the link to Gist.


### Task Details

The steps above assume one thing: You know the very basics about using your computer.
If you don't understand how your computer works you need to take some classes, explore, and learn.
Don't go beyond this point until you do.
Ruby, and other languages, are tools and tools require that much respect to use.


### Extra Credit

1. Open a few text files with gedit and get to know the interface.
2. Customize Gedit, Terminal, and your Operating System to better suit your style.
3. Go to the Learn You The Ruby website and read through the glossary.
4. Type these in the Terminal:
    1. `rvm use 1.9.2@global`
    2. `gem install bundler heroku rake rack`
    4. `rvm use 1.9.2`
