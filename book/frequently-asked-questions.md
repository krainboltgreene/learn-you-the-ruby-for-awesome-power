FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
==========================

> **Q**: Is (Ruby||Programming) hard to learn?

**A**: Programming is largely four things: Effort, Learning, Syntax, and Paradigms.
This shouldn't be surprising, but the effort is the hardest part about learning how to program.
Without the effort to work on things yourself you'll never go forward as a learner, no matter how much you read.
The latter three are self explanitory, but here you go: You have to be willing to learn, constantly.
Programming is a moving target even if you want to work with old stuff.
Finally, learning any language requires learning the facets of the Paradigm and the particular syntax the language uses.


> **Q**: Who are you?

**A**: I'm a hacker, writer, designer, and father.
I have a keen interest in pushing the programming community forward by making it easier to jump into.
Luckily I was gifted with the ability, fortitude, and foolishness to write a learning book.


> **Q**: Why do you like Ruby?

**A**: I like Ruby because it's expressive syntax, and it's affinity for Domain Specific Languages.
It was the first language I ever used seriously, and I hope to continue working with it.
It also happens that I can make a lot of money developing in Ruby.


> **Q**: Who built this website?

**A**: I built this website!
All of it.
To elaborate I wrote the HTML with HAML, and the CSS with SASS.
Each chapter is formatted with the Discount markdown language.
The web site runs on Sinatra, a simple micro web framework.


> **Q**: Why did you build this website?

**A**: I built this website because I felt the tutorials out there, excluding \_why's, were dry and unapproachable.
For a language that is as expressive and fun to develop with as Ruby, this seems like such a tragedy.


> **Q**: Have you built any others?

**A**: Other **Learn You The**'s? Not yet, but I seriously plan to.
I look forward to finishing the LYTR website only to do a Factor, HTML/CSS, and many many more if I have the time.
It's a rather time consuming task and I do love to bog myself down in projects.


> **Q**: Can you help me make my own?

**A**: I can and will help those who want to help others, all you have to do is contact
me.


> **Q**: You stole this from (LYAH || LYSE || LPTHW), didn't you!?

**A**: Arrrgh, you found out my diabolical scheme...
Actually, no it's more like "I was incredibly inspired by that book."
The creators seem to enjoy my book, and that's really awesome for me.


> **Q**: Is this website available in Russian?

**A**: No, sadly it isn't available in Russian...Yet!
I plan to have this work translated into as many languages as I possibly can.
At the very least provide links to Google Translate.
Because I'm lazy and poor, and that is easy and free.


> **Q**: What's with the duck and Soviet theme then?

**A**: That's actually a good question.
It's a rather obscure joke that I will attempt to explain:
You see, Ruby is a Duck-Typed language, right?
And Ruby, the precious gem, is red (So is the color, obviously)!
...Which is the primary color in Soviet Russia!
So you see, it all makes sense:
*In Soviet Ruby, Duck Types You!*


> **Q**: Are you a Socialist/Communist/Leninist?

**A**: I do sport an awesome goatee.
