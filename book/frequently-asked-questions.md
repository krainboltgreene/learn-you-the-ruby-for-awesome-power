Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

> **Q**: Is Ruby hard to learn?

**A**: Ruby isn't hard to pick up at all if you're willing to learn. In fact you 
should be able to learn Ruby very quickly as long as you take the guide slowly, 
include other resources, and (most importantly) experiment! New programmers will
find Ruby's expressiveness to be quite enjoyable!

> **Q**: Who are you?

**A**: I'm a hacker, writer, designer, and father with a keen interest in pushing the 
programming community forward by making it easier to slip into. I think the 
programming community is far too obfuscated for it's own good. This leads to 
less developers as older ones leave the community and newer ones avoid it.

> **Q**: Why do you like Ruby?

**A**: I like Ruby because it's expressive nature and the community's affinity for 
DSLs. It was the first real language I learned. I've seen the worst of the 
worst used with the utmost seriousness and Ruby is a bright light in my rather 
jaded past.

> **Q**: Who built this website?

**A**: I built this website! All of it. To elaborate I wrote the website with HAML, and
styled it with SASS. These are both Ruby Gems that take the DSL they've created 
and turn it into HTML and CSS respectively. The web site is run with Sinatra, a 
simple micro web framework. The server for the site is Thin, which is also 
written in Ruby. Each chapter is formatted with the Discount markdown language 
(sounds strange, I know). The Task sources are hosted on Github's Gist, although
the styles were done by me.

> **Q**: Why did you build this website?

**A**: I built this website because I felt that the guides and tutorials to Rub y on 
the Internet and in print for Ruby, excluding \_why's, were dry and 
unapproachable. For a language that is as expressive and fun to develop with as 
Ruby this seems like such a tragedy.

> **Q**: Have you built any others?

**A**: Other **Learn You An**'s? Not yet, but I seriously plan to. I look forward to 
finishing the LYAR website only to do a Learn You An Factor, Learn You An 
Clojure, and many many more if I have the time.

> **Q**: Can you help me make my own?

**A**: I can and will help those who want to help others, all you have to do is contact 
me.

> **Q**: You stole this from [LYAH || LYSE], didn't you!?

**A**: Arrrgh, you found out my diabolical scheme! ... Actually, no I didn't really 
steal the ideas from **Learn You A Haskell** or **Learn You Some Erlang**. Both 
creators seem to enjoy my website, and I have them to thank for inspiring me to 
do these types of web guides.


> **Q**: Is this website available in Russian?

**A**: No, sadly it isn't available in Russian...Yet! I plan to have this work 
translated into as many languages as I possibly can, or at the very least 
provide links to Google Translate. Because I'm lazy and poor.

> **Q**: What's with the duck and Soviet theme then?

**A**: That's actually a good question. It's a rather obscure joke. You see, Ruby is 
a Duck Typed language, right? And Ruby, the gem, is red! So a lot of Ruby things
are red...Which is the primary color in Soviet Russia! So you see, it all makes
sense: In Soviet Ruby, Duck Types You!

> **Q**: Are you a Socialist/Communist/Leninist?

**A**: I do sport an awesome goatee.
